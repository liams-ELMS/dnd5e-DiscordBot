# dnd5e-DiscordBot
A discord bot that uses www.dnd5eapi.co to display information from the dnd5e basic rules to users via commands in discord

Hello, thank you for looking at my discord bot
With some help from ChatGPT, I was able to get this up and running to do what I wished
This was done as my final project in a data analytics class

To get this up and running in your own server you will need to:
  On Line 34: Replace "Channel code" with the code for the channel you want the bot to respond in
  On Line 461: Place in your discord bot token
